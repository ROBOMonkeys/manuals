** Setting up
*** PIP
    pip is a python package installer
    pulls packages from the web and sets them up on your system
*** PyFRC
    pyfrc is a python port of the Java API for FRC Robotics
    installing this package will install all necessary classes and functions for basic robot control, e.g. driving, using motors, firing pistons, etc.
** Learning
   To start learning how to code for a basic robot go to  https://robotpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/index.html and read
*** Misc Info
    We currently use the IterativeRobot class for our robot, so learning and coding based off of those examples will be the most helpful
    We usually use Solenoids, Talons, and RobotDrive classes so looking into those classes would be the most helpful and productive.
    We have custom made classes for using Xbox controllers for our controllers, so learning how to use that would also be helpful: http://www.github.com/ROBOMonkeys/enums/
    

* TODO 
    add info about git
    add documentation for XboxButtons/XboxAxis
    add pics
    add activities and projects
